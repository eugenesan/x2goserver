Description: X2Go Server's X2Go Agent
 X2Go is a software suite that uses NX technology for remote desktop
 computing.
 .
 NX technology implements a very efficient compression of the X11 protocol.
 This increases performance when using X applications over a network,
 especially a slow one.
 .
 X2Go agent functionality has been completely incorporated into NX agent's
 code base. If the nxagent binary is executed under the name of `x2goagent',
 the X2Go functionalities get activated.
 .
 The x2goagent package is a wrapper that activates X2Go branding in nxagent.
 Please refer to the nxagent package's description for more information on NX.

 .
 The x2goserver package provides full functionality
 for running the X2Go project's legacy X2Go client
 (x2goclient) on the client-side.
 .
 However, if you intend using other client implementations 
 of X2Go make sure that you also have X2Go server
 extensions package (x2goserver-extensions) installed.

 backend. If CUPS server and X2Go server are hosted
 on different machines, then make sure you install
 this package on the X2Go server/s (and the cups-x2go
 package on the CUPS server).

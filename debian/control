 The X2Go Server printing package provides client-side printing support
 for X2Go.
 .
 This package has to be installed on X2Go Servers that shall be able to
 pass X2Go print jobs on to the X2Go client.
 .
 This package co-operates with the cups-x2go CUPS backend. If CUPS server
 and X2Go Server are hosted on different machines, then make sure you
 install this package on the X2Go Server/s (and the cups-x2go package on
 the CUPS server).

Description: X2Go Server's X2Go Agent
 X2Go is a software suite that uses NX technology for remote desktop
 computing.
 .
 NX technology implements a very efficient compression of the X11
 protocol. This increases performance when using X applications over a
 network, especially a slow one.
 .
 X2Go agent functionality has been completely incorporated into NX
 agent's code base. If the nxagent binary is executed under the name of
 `x2goagent', the X2Go functionalities get activated.
 .
 This package is a wrapper that activates X2Go branding in nxagent.
 Please refer to the nxagent package's description for more information
 on NX.

 desktop sessions with X2Go.
 .
 Amongst others the parsing of Xsession scripts will enable
 desktop-profiles, ssh-agent startups, gpgagent startups and many more
 Xsession related features on X2Go session login automagically.

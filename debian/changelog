x2goserver (4.1.0.0-0x2go1.2) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ Mike Gabriel ]
  * Bump development upstream version to 4.1.0.0.
  * New upstream version (4.1.0.0):
    - Transform x2gologlevel.pm into proper Perl module X2Go::Log.
    - Transform x2godbwrapper.pm into proper Perl module X2Go::Server::DB.
    - Transform x2gosqlitewrapper.pl into small wrapper script and move the
      SQLite3 into Perl package X2Go::Server::DB::SQLite3.
    - Move x2gosqlitewrapper into Perl package X2Go::Server::DB::SQLite3.
    - Move PostgreSQL DB code into Perl package X2Go::Server::DB::PostgreSQL.
    - Move X2Go SQL configuration files (/etc/x2go/x2gosql) into package
      libx2go-server-db-perl.
    - Install /etc/x2go/x2go_logout with its directory x2go_logout.d via
      Makefile installation.
    - Fix new SQLite3 wrapper for db_getmounts Perl call.
    - Fix list output in new SQLite3 wrapper.
    - Make session type label XFCE a valid session that starts xfce4-session.
    - Fix failures of x2gogetagent that was related to faulty regexp in
      SQLite3 DB wrapper script.
    - Add X2Go Server feature X2GO_LIST_SHADOWSESSIONS.
    - Break execution of x2gosuspend-session / x2goterminate-session if the
      script is called without session as first argument and $X2GO_SESSION
      not set. (Fixes: #82).
    - Make x2goruncommand aware of the Cinnamon desktop shell. (Fixes: #117).
    - Fix build-arch target in x2goserver/Makefile. (Fixes: #121).
    - Load config files from a Perl package (X2Go::Config).
    - Disable SupeReNicer by default.
    - Fix session handling for cross-user-account desktop sharing. Now session
      names of desktop sharing session start with the username of the user who
      is requesting the desktop sharing, rather than the username of the person
      who shares his/her desktop.
    - Do not superenice desktop sharing / shadow sessions.
    - Drop obsolete components x2goserver-compat, x2goserver-pyhoca.
    - Makefile: pre-set the PERL_INSTALLDIRS var with ,,vendor''. Use
      pure_install rather than install.
    - Avoid one argument system calls in x2golistshadowsessions.
    - Provide Perl functions to capture stdout/stderr with multi-argument system
      calls.
    - Avoid one argument system calls and backticks in SupeReNicer.
    - Handle situations in SupeReNicer where the agent PID is not set.
    - Start working on an abstraction layer (as Perl
      package X2Go::Server::Agent) that handles all (NX) agent specific actions.
      Move duplicate code into that new Perl package.
    - Security audit of complete code tree, avoid one-argument system calls
      where possible, avoid backticks, use more quotes in shell scripts.
    - Add tunneling port allocation for TeleKinesis framework.
    - Only use teki_* fields with PostgreSQL DB backend if TeKi is enabled.
    - Provide --updatedb feature in x2godbadmin if DB backend is PostgreSQL.
    - Execute post-start.d extension scripts _after_ the session information has
      been submitted to the session DB. This allows execution of
      x2golistsessions and other X2Go commands in post-start.d extension
      scripts.
    - Re-arrange parameter order of x2gocreatesession and related DB functions.
      Make sure the session ID comes first and we have only optional parameters
      towards the end of the parameter array.
    - Fix accessing ARGV in X2Go::Utils:check_x2go_sessionid sub. (Fixes:
      #575).
    - Fix TeKi storing Telekinesis ports in PgSQL-based session DB. Allow
      negative
      port numbers for the case that Telekinesis is not installed.
    - Fix db_insertmount (SQLite). Pathnames must not be enclosed by
      parentheses.
    - Make sure to return "1" in X2Go::Server::DB Perl functions that don't
      return anything by default.
    - Make it possible to change the state of shadow sessions.
    - Provide --debug option for x2gocleansession that allows running
      x2gocleansessions in foreground (and in debug mode).
    - Properly clean up shadow sessions for the session database.
    - Move x2goagent wrapper package around nxagent into X2Go Server.
      (Fixes: #1047).
    - Update execution logic of the x2goagent wrapper script. The script now
      sets the env var $NXAPP and then calls the nxagent wrapper script. For
      this to work properly, the x2goagent symlinks has to be placed into
      directory where the nxagent executable is installed ($LIBDIR/nx/bin/,
      normally).
    - Revisit packaging for latest change in x2goserver-x2goagent. Don't inject
      $(LIBDIR) rather than injecting $(NXLIBDIR) via debian/rules and
      x2goserver.spec.
    - x2goagent wrapper script: Use exec command to launch nxagent. Put "$@" in
      quotes.
  * debian/control:
    + Package X2Go::Log in separate package: libx2go-log-perl.
    + Package X2Go::Server::DB in separate package: libx2go-server-db-perl.
    + x2goserver package: Depend on libx2go-log-perl, libx2go-server-db-perl.
    + Move x2goserver.conf into separate package: x2goserver-common.
    + Use Breaks/Replaces to exchange x2goserver.conf in x2goserver package by

    + Move several x2goserver-* package to x2goserver's Recommends field.
    + Add Reinhard Tartler to Uploaders.
    + Add libcatpure-tiny-perl to Depends: field of libx2go-server-perl.
    + Move x2gosql config to x2goserver-common.
    + Several style and dependency fixes. Use Conflicts: instead of Breaks:
      for unversioned package conflicts.
    + Test if telekinesis-server is installed server-side. If so,
      prepare the telekinesis session sub-directory.
    + Add D (bin:package libx2go-server-db-perl): libswitch-perl.
  * debian/x2goserver.postinst, debian/libx2go-server-db-perl:
    + Handle X2Go session DB creation in x2goserver _and_
      perl-X2Go-Server-DB on postinst.
    - Make sure X2Go session DB files get updated during postinst.
  * debian/libx2go-server-db-perl installation scripts:
    + Remove dpkg-statoverride during remove on prerm, not on purge in postrm.
  * debian/x2goserver.init:
    + Rely on $PATH when invoking x2gocleansessions.
  * debian/x2goserver.service:
    + Provide systemd service file.
  * Move code in pre/post+inst/rm scripts around (from x2goserver package
    to libx2go-server-db-perl and x2goserver-common).
  * debian/copyright:
    + Provide DEP-5 compliant copyright file.
    + Add copyright.in auto-generated file (by licensecheck+CDBS) for later
      reference.
  * debian/x2goserver-x2goagent:
    + Make sure the .features file for x2goserver-x2goagent ends up in its
      bin:pkg.
  * x2goserver.spec:
    + Bring debian/control and x2goclient.spec in sync.
    + Make sure x2godbadmin is evoked from package x2goserver.
    + Handle X2Go session DB creation in x2goserver _and_
      perl-X2Go-Server-DB on postinst.
    + Set buildroot if we build for EPEL-5.
    + Use deprecated %{_initrddir} macro for EPEL-5 builds.
    + Take advantage of native RHEL support (since 4.0.1.10).
    + Install SQLite3 wrapper as setgid x2gouser. (Fixes: 371).
    + Assure that SQLite3 session DB file gets created on install (unless
      PostgreSQL is used as session DB backend).
    + Make sure x2goserver-*.features files do not get installed
      multiple times into various packages.
    + Make sure X2Go Server (x2gocleansessions) starts after installation.
    + Make sure X2Go session DB files get updated during postinst.
    + Require Perl(Switch) (bin:package x2goserver).
    + Don't fail in %post during X2Go session DB creation.
    + Fix call of x2godbadmin --updatedb during package upgrade.
    + Hand over %{_prefix}/%{_libdir}/nx as $NXLIBDIR to x2goserver's Makefiles.
      Required for x2goagent symlink to be properly installed into the same
      folder where the nxagent executable gets installed.
    + Also hand over %{_prefix}/%{_libdir}/nx as $NXLIBDIR when executing make
      install.
    + Add B-R: nxagent. Needed for %{_prefix}/%{_libdir}/nx/bin to be owned.

  [ Guangzhou Nianguan Electronics Technology Co.Ltd. ]
  * New upstream version (4.1.0.0):
    - Add SupeReNicer support.
    - Provide string sanitizers. Esp. a sanitizer for X2Go session IDs.

  [ Otto Kjell ]
  * New upstream version (4.1.0.0):
    - Add markdown files for most of the X2Go Server project folders. (Fixes:
      #102).
    - Fix "server" command line option for x2golistsessions call in
      x2golistdesktops.

  [ Orion Poplawski ]
  * New upstream version (4.1.0.0):
    - Use new script x2gopath in Perl::API. (Fixes: #86).

  [ Oleksandr Shneyder ]
  * New upstream version (4.1.0.0):
    - Fix x2godbadmin. Set right column name "tekidata_port" in create table.
      (Fixes: #557).
    - Unset LD_LIBRARY_PATH for the case when x2gostartagent started from x2godesktopsharing.

  [ Mark Pederson-Cook ]
  * debian/po:
    + Translate DebConf templates to Danish.

  [Kaan Ozdincer ]
  * debian/po:
    + Translate DebConf templates to Turkish.

  [ Mihai Moldovan ]
  * New upstream version (4.1.0.0):
    - x2goserver/sbin/x2gocleansessions: add timestamp to debug output.
    - x2goserver/sbin/x2gocleansessions: also (correctly) log to syslog if
      started with --debug parameter.
    - libx2go-server-db-perl/lib/libx2go-server-db-sqlite3-wrapper.pl: don't
      use deprecated defined (@array) construct which never really did what one
      would expect (defined () can only be used on scalar values.)
    - x2goserver/bin/x2gofeaturelist: whitespace only.
    - x2goserver-x2goagent/: rename share/x2go/rgb back to etc/rgb.
    - x2goserver-x2goagent/Makefile: install etc/rgb as in
      ${SYSCONFDIR}/x2go/rgb again and create a symlink from that to
      ${DATADIR}/x2go/rgb.
    - x2goserver-x2goagent/Makefile: fix left-over reference to
      share/x2go/rgb. It's back to etc/rgb now.
    - x2goserver-x2goagent/share/x2go/x2gofeature.d/: rename
      x2goserver-agent.features to x2goserver-x2goagent.features.
  * x2goserver.spec:
    - Only create session DB in x2goserver's post install script. Do use
      proper Requires(post) statements to make sure perl-X2Go-Server-DB and
      x2goserver-common are available when x2goserver's post install script is
      being executed. Fixes installation bugs reported by Michael DePaulo.
    - Add support for %{_datadir}/applications symlink in %{_sysconfdir}/x2go.
      + Add creation and deletion bits to %post and %preun scriptlets.
      + Refactor %post, %pre, %postun and %preun scriptlets to accommodate for
        last change.
      + Don't use %{_sbindir} for chkconfig and service on SLE{S,D}.
        %{_sbindir} is a macro for /usr/sbin/, whereas chkconfig and service
        reside in /sbin/.
    - Change deprecated and removed PreReq to Requires(pre) header.
    - Move shadow/shadow-utils/pwdutils Requires to x2goserver-common sub
      package (where they are actually needed.)
    - Re-add etc/rgb as a config file.
    - Correctly create and specify the x2goserver-x2goagent subpackage,
      instead of a standalone x2goagent package.
    - Fix dependency upon versioned nxagent.
    - Let x2goserver depend upon x2goagent-virtual, add Provides: keyword to
      x2goserver-x2goagent (also need to be implemented within X2Go's nx-libs
      master branch.)
    - Add script/symlink ${LIBDIR}/x2go/bin/x2goagent to installed file list.
    - Split up x2gosql installed file list part into actual directories and
      files.
    - Disable stale symlinks check for now (and add comment to re-enable it
      once we've switched to nx-libs 3.5.99 or higher for good.)
    - Actually export NO_BRP_STALE_LINK_ERROR in a correct way/with the
      correct value. Never blindly trust the internets if something looks odd.
    - Add %{_libdir}/x2go/bin as owned directory for x2goserver-x2goagent.
      Also owned by the alternative package x2goagent in nx-libs.
    - Exclude %{_bindir}/x2goagent from being packaged into x2goserver
      package.
  * debian/control:
    - Maintainer change in package: X2Go Developers <x2go-dev@lists.x2go.org>.
  * debian/:
    - Remove x2goserver-x2goagent.dirs and hope it's really unneeded, because
      the Makefile creates these directories correctly.
  * debian/x2goserver-x2goagent.install:
    - Re-add etc/rgb file.

x2goserver (4.0.1.20-0x2go1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ Mike DePaulo ]
  * New upstream version (4.0.1.20):
    - TERMINAL Session: Add support for qterminal
      (Lightweight terminal emulator written in Qt)
    - TRINITY: Add support for Q4OS

  [ Mihai Moldovan ]
  * New upstream version (4.0.1.20):
    - x2goserver/bin/x2gogetapps: respect NoDisplay and Hidden values, don't
      parse the full desktop file if there are non-Desktop Entries groups.
      Based on a patch submitted by Jason Alavaliant. Fixes: #812.
    - x2goserver/bin/x2gogetapps: do not print spurious newlines.
    - Change string "X2go" to "X2Go" where appropriate.
    - Add runcommand.d hooks to x2goserver-extensions Makefile.
    - x2goserver/bin/x2gosessionlimit: don't iterate over the whole groups
      file. Only check the primary and secondary groups as returned by
      getgid()/getgroups(). Fixes long delays in session startup on machines
      with a gazillion of groups.
    - x2goserver/sbin/x2gocleansessions: re-fetch the current sessions' status
      before handling it. Using the "cached" value from the initial
      x2golistsessions run may be desynchronized with the actual current
      value. Avoids a race condition logging users out after they attached to a
      session.
    - x2goserver/sbin/x2gocleansessions: rename %remembered_sessions_since to
      %remembered_sessions_status_since. That's what it really is. Add
      comments to further clarify what it's actually doing. Change it to
      include a timestamp instead of the "iteration count multiplied by two"
      value. Compare timestamps to see if killing hanging nxagent processes is
      necessary.
    - x2goserver/sbin/x2gocleansessions: rename
      %remembered_sessions_status_since to
      %remembered_sessions_status_since_time. Add
      %remembered_sessions_status_since_iterations that will come in handy for
      the next change.
    - x2goserver/sbin/x2gocleansessions: give suspended-but-running sessions a
      grace period of one iteration. Fixes: #888.
    - x2goserver/sbin/x2gocleansessions: fix ugly missing whitespace.
    - x2goserver/sbin/x2gocleansessions: move up session status sync a bit,
      don't update session state when session has been removed from the
      database.
    - x2goserver/sbin/x2gocleansessions: unify log messages. Move dangling
      line around.
    - x2goserver/sbin/x2gocleansessions: whitespace only.
    - x2goserver/sbin/x2gocleansessions: also delete entries in the other,
      overlooked hashes.
    - x2goserver/sbin/x2gocleansessions: move socket and lock file cleanup
      into time-based block for finished/failed sessions.
    - x2goserver/sbin/x2gocleansessions: add @remembered_finished_sessions
      array. Merge with session list as queried from the database (won't
      include finished/failed sessions) and remember F-state sessions via this
      array. Only delete elements once work on these has been finished.
    - x2goserver/sbin/x2gocleansessions: don't add failed/finished sessions to
      remembered list if that list already includes them.
    - x2goserver/sbin/x2gocleansessions: don't use gmtime (time ()) but merely
      time (). The former one returns a formatted date-time string, which
      can't be checked by forming a difference. The latter one returns an UNIX
      timestamp, which is what we really want... minus leap seconds. Let's
      hope this doesn't bite back some time or later...
    - x2goserver/sbin/x2gocleansessions: add debugging output to show the
      state change when updating the cached state result.
    - x2goserver/sbin/x2gocleansessions: only output status refreshing debug
      message if the old and new states actually differ. Prevents log spam.
    - x2goserver/bin/x2gostartagent: changes to Robert Nowotny's SSH_PORT
      patch. Fixes: #922. Use default outgoing interface to determine IP
      address. Use the whole range of ${RANDOM}'s pool. Seed it for good
      measure. Change the default method to randomization instead of IP-based
      initialization. If IP-based initialization was requested but the default
      outgoing IP address unavailable, fall back to randomization.
    - x2goserver/bin/x2goruncommand: whitespace and comment changes only.
    - x2goserver/bin/x2gocleansessions: replace system_capture_stdout_output()
      with actual implementation. We don't have that function on the release
      branch.
    - x2goserver-xsession/etc/Xsession: use /bin/bash explicitly on RedHat-,
      Gentoo- and SuSE-based systems. Users might change /bin/sh to point to a
      shell like mksh or dash, which do not support the -l or -c flags to
      exec. C.f., BGO #575022 (Gentoo.)
    - x2goserver/bin/x2gomountdirs: remove blowfish Cipher spec hardcoded for
      sshfs mounts. The speed improvement is probably mostly an illusion
      (unless talking about high-bandwidth links) and more importantly recent
      OpenSSH server versions seem to disable the Blowfish cipher by default,
      leading to errors like "Connection reset by peer."
    - x2goserver/bin/x2goruncommand: whitespace only.
    - x2goserver/sbin/x2gocleansessions: add Perl documentation and --help,
      -h, -? and --man options. Fixes: #1065. Also print a usage message on
      unknown options.
    - x2goserver/man/man8/x2gocleansessions.8: drop obsolete man page.
    - x2goserver-xsession/etc/Xsession: fix uname calls when (potentially)
      creating session log/error file and add uname call where necessary.
    - x2goserver-xsession/etc/Xsession: include hostname in
      xsession-x2go-errors file name. Part of #923.
    - x2goserver-xsession/etc/Xsession: rotate old log/error file before
      appending new data. Fixes: #923.
    - x2goserver-xsession/etc/Xsession: fix wrong variable usage.
      Fixes: #1073.
  * x2goserver.spec:
    - Add sudo and logcheck as BuildRequires and Requires. Don't own
      directories that are owned by sudo and logcheck. Logcheck is not
      available on *SUSE, FC < 20 and RHEL, so for those distros still own the
      directories.
    - Typo fix in comment: Recommands -> Recommends.
    - Fix installation on OpenSUSE 12.3 and higher: has replaced pwdutils with
      shadow. Also affects SLE{S,D} 12.
    - Add workaround documentation for sudoers on *SUSE 11.
    - Add shadow/shadow-utils/pwdutils Requires to x2goserver-printing
      sub package.
    - Add new dependency on bash.
    - Add new dependency on xkeyboard-config to x2goserver. Fixes: #903.
    - Add new dependency on perl and the Cwd module to x2goserver-xsession.
      Part of #923.
  * debian/control:
    - Add new dependency on bash.
    - Add new dependency on xkb-data to x2goserver.
    - Maintainer change in package: X2Go Developers <x2go-dev@lists.x2go.org>.
    - Uploaders: add myself. Also, force a rebuild due to the changed
      versioning.
    - Add new dependency on perl-modules for Cwd. Part of #923.

    - Do not search for unavailable file in x2goserver's post
      install script.  Fixes installation bugs reported by Michael DePaulo.
    - Add support for %{_datadir}/applications symlink in %{_sysconfdir}/x2go.
      + Add creation and deletion bits to %post and %preun scriptlets.

x2goserver (4.0.1.19-0x2go1) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Mike Gabriel ]
  * New upstream version (4.0.1.19):
    - Use File::Which to detect if sshfs command is available
      before trying to mount a client-side folder.
    - Be a bit more tolerant when trying to detect if a
      desktop icon is to be removed (using regexp, not
      eq).
    - Xsession script: Prevent bash failures when sourcing external bash
      scripts beyond our scope. (Fixes: #632, #675).
    - x2gogetapps: Support scanning of sub-directories when searching for
      .desktop files. We allow to dive down one level into subdirs, we on
      purpose do not recursively dive into the complete subtree. (Fixes: #633).
    - Make man2html an optional tool. Don't fail if it is missing on the
      build system (required for openSUSE/SLES builds).
    - Fix x2goserver-xsession/Makefile on SUSE. Detect SUSE distro and create
      Xsession related directory symlinks (xinitrc.d and Xclients.d).
    - Hack for x2goserver-xsession/Makefile during SUSE builds. If
      directoy /usr/share/doc/packages/brp-check-suse is present, the build env
      is also considered to be a SUSE system.
    - Trigger Xsession code for SUSE systems (look for /etc/SUSE-brand or
      /etc/SuSE-release for SUSE system recognition). (Fixes: #671).
    - x2gosqlitewrapper.c: Fix rpmlint error: no-return-in-nonvoid-function.
      Return the exitcode of execve().
    - Fix gramma in error message (in x2goresume-session).
    - x2gocleansessions: Call x2gormforward also on terminated sessions. This
      will make sure that re-assigned ports are really available on new session
      startup.
    - x2golistsessions(_root): Only update session state in session DB if
      x2goagent's state file really exists. This addresses a problem that occurs
      when x2golistsessions gets called via an x2gobroker-agent. The
      x2golistsessions script may show session states (--all-servers) of
      sessions on other servers that have session states files on their remote
      /tmp dirs. These files are not accessible for that x2golistsessions script
      and should simply be ignored. (Fixes: #638).
    - Provide pam_namespace support for has_agent_state_file() function.
    - Fix missing session list output if state file does not exist on the
      machine that runs x2golistsessions(_root).
    - Accept more verbose "DENY" output from x2godesktopsharing.
    - Make sure that all "su"-to-user-contexts use /bin/sh for wrapping around
      the executed command (in x2gocleansessions and x2golistsessions_root).
    - Also enforce /bin/sh as shell in su command in x2goprint.
    - README.i18n: Add file that explains the translation workflow for
      this package. Thanks to Mark Pedersen-Cook for drafting this file.
    - Make SSH agent forwarding work after having reconnected via SSH and
      having resumed a session. (Fixes: #672). Thanks to Robert Siemer for
      coming up with that idea.
    - Fix cross-user X2Go Desktop Sharing after being broken by implementing
      clipboard mode feature (and probably other code changes).
    - Document session startup / resumption failures (and their reasons) in
      server-side log output.
    - Handle AD domain users gracefully when X2Go is used with SQLite DB
      backend. (Fixes: #664).
    - Improve sanitizer, use 'x2gosid' sanitizer for session IDs everywhere.
      Drop unused 'pnixusername' sanitizer in 4.0.1.x release of X2Go Server.
    - Allow usernames in session IDs of length 48 chars.
    - Start sshfs with a timeout of 30 seconds (because it never finishes if
      something is wrong with the client-side TCP socket). Also remove/unmount
      mountpoints erroneously registered sshfs mountpoints if sshfs command
      times out. Furthermore, print errors to STDERR (not STDOUT). (Fixes:
      #405).
    - Handle execution of ss command from Perl script x2golistdesktops in a way
      that not only works on Debian, but also on Fedora et al. (Fixes: #727).
    - Provide legacy support for old File::Path packages in x2godbadmin.
      (Fixes: #715).
    - Fix wrong evocation of x2gosyslog ("error" -> "err").
    - Use "undef $dbh" instead of "$dbh->disconnect()". Fixes SQLite3 issues on
      SLE 11.x.
    - Only call $dbh->sqlite_busy_timeout() if the $dbh object is capable of
      that. Works around a too-old DBD::SQLite package on SLE 11.x.
    - Legacy for applications (and X2Go scripts) that expect $SSH_CLIENT to be
      set in the X2Go session's environment. (Fixes: #644).
    - Add man page for x2gogetapps. Weave into that a security / disclaimer
      message as proposed by Stefan Baur. (Fixes: #728).

x2goserver (4.0.1.16-0x2go1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Mike DePaulo ]
  * New upstream release (4.0.1.16):
    - Make X2Go Server aware of the Openbox desktop environment
      (Command: OPENBOX) (Fixes: #605)
    - Make X2Go Server aware of the IceWM desktop environment
      (Command: ICEWM) (Fixes: #606)
    - Support GNOME Flashback session (GNOME 3.8+) on distro releases such as
      Ubuntu 13.10+ and debian Jessie
      (NOTE: For most users, GNOME Flashback currently will not work.
       This requires that gnome-flashback.session actually be installed. Not
       every Linux distro has it available.
       It also requires that the gnome-session binary not require
       hardware 3D acceleration for said session. Currently, upstream GNOME
       and GNOME 3.8+ in all Linux distros do require this, only 3rd party
       builds do not. See X2Go bug #599 for example.)
      (Thanks Eugene San (eugenesan@gmail.com))
    - Fix launching GNOME 3 Fallback session (GNOME 3.4 & 3.6) on distros other
      than Ubuntu and Debian (Fixes: #599)
    - Fix support for Cinnamon 1.4 (Linux Mint 13) (Fixes: #569)
    - Fix the logic for launching Cinnamon 2.0 and 2.2 (Linux Mint 17).
      (Fixes: #572)
      NOTE: Fixing this bug in x2goserver is not sufficient to make Cinnamon 2.0
      & 2.2 to work properly with X2Go. Bug #150 in nx-libs is still a problem.
      Fixing this bug enables Cinnamon 2.0 and 2.2 to launch to their
      "fallback mode", which has many bugs and missing features when compared to
      "software rendering" mode (cinnamon2d), but is still better than nothing.
  * debian/rules:
    + Improve dh_auto_clean override.

  [ Mike Gabriel ]
  * New upstream version (4.0.1.16):
    - Let x2goversion exit with an error if the X2Go component cannot be
      found.
    - Detect terminated sessions from NX log file. Also interpret a session as
      terminated if terminating just has started.
    - Detect started/starting/resumed/resuming sessions by explicitly scanning
      the NX session log file for those keywords.
    - Interpret NX sessions marked as "aborting session" as (not yet) terminated
      sessions.
    - Provide config option for server-side/global clipboard behaviour in
      x2goagent.options. (Fixes: #506).
    - Be aware of poly-instantiated /tmp directories bind-mounted under
      /tmp-inst. (Fixes: #406).
    - On suspend: Call x2goumount-session before sending SIGHUP to x2goagent.
    - Refuse client communcation if server-side hostname is not set up
      correctly (Fixes: #468).
    - Fix string comparison in x2goumount-session.
    - Fix problems with unmounting shared folders on session suspension/
      termination. Remove extra parentheses from the fusermount execution
      call. (Fixes: #407).
    - Use type -p instead of which in x2goumount-session. Suppress output
      to stdout properly.
    - Use if--then--else--fi during x2goagent resuming in x2goresume-session
      script.
    - More reliably sync the NX session state with the status information in
      the X2Go session DB.
    - x2golistdesktops: Also detect sharable desktop sessions behind abstract
      kernel namespace sockets.
    - Add logcheck rules for X2Go Server. Thanks to Frank Werner for sending
      them in.
    - Correctly use diversions from stderr to stdout in shell commands.
      (Fixes: #520).
    - Don't die if no session state file is found, as it will break X2Go
      completely after upgrading from versions << 4.0.1.16 if sessions
      are still running/suspended during package upgrade.
    - Provide support for client-side choice of clipboard security. (Fixes:
      #524).
    - Use more quotes in x2goruncommand.
    - Detect the exit of rootless applications that forked to background on
      application execution. (Fixes: #122).
    - Make x2goruncommand more robust.
    - Don't fail Xsession startup if any of the profile scripts returns
      with an error.
    - Silently timeout in x2golistdesktops if calls to x2golistsessions and/or
      xwininfo don't produce output within one second. (Fixes: #543).
    - Allow email addresses as login usernames. (Fixes: #573).
    - Abort session startup if env var $USER or $SSH_CLIENT are not set.
      (Fixes: #558).
    - Allow length of username up to 48 characters (was: 32 characters). (Fixes:
      #574).
    - Abort session if env var $HOME is not set or if $HOME contains non-ASCII
      characters. (Fixes: #397).
    - Export XAUTHORITY env var in x2goruncommand to enable privilege upgrade
      for applications started via pkexec. (Fixes: #458).
    - x2gocleansessions: Don't print to stderr if the session state file cannot
      be found. This can happen during session startups. Report to system log
      instead.
    - Don't use Perl package File::ReadBackwards anymore.
    - Fix x2gormforward for 4.0.1.x release series (the X2Go::Log Perl module
      only exists in X2Go Server >= 4.1.0.0, the 4.0.1.x release series has to
      use x2gologlevel.pm in `x2gopath lib`. (Fixes: #617).
    - Pick x2gogetagentstate from 4.1.0.0 release series and adapt to usage
      with X2Go Server 4.0.1.x. (Fixes: #619).
  * debian/control, x2goserver.spec:
    + Update versioned D: x2goagent (>= 3.5.0.25). This assures that X2Go
      works with poly-instantiated /tmp directories.
    + Make sure x2gogetagentstate gets packaged in bin:package x2goserver.
    + Bump Standards: to 3.9.5. No changes needed.
    + Mark x2goserver-pyhoca bin:package as deprecated.
    + Drop D (x2goserver): libfile-readbackwards-perl.
  * x2goserver.spec:
    + Install {libdir}/x2go/x2gormforward into bin:package x2goserver.
    + Drop R (x2goserver): perl(File::ReadBackwards).

  [ Oleksandr Shneyder ]
  * New upstream version (4.0.1.16):

      x2goresume-session getting agent state from ~/.x2go/C-$SID/state. This
      should help to avoid session damage. Remove nxcleanup. (Fixes: #302,
      #511).
    - Move session file to /tmp/.x2go-$USER. (Fixes: #523).
    - Fix x2gostartagent failures if kbd is not "auto". Remove comma at end of
      options file.
    - Set default value for clipboard to "both" in x2gostartagent and
      x2goresume-session.
    - Clean user SSHD process if connection between server and client lost.
      This should fix error "Global request tcpip-forward failed". (Fixes:

  * New upstream release (4.0.1.14):
    - Log SSHFS output and errors to ~/.x2go/C-<session>/sshfs-mounts.log.
      (Fixes: #415).
    - If x2golistmounts is used without cmd option <session_id>, then
      the env var $X2GO_SESSION (current session) will be attempted to use.
    - If x2goumount-session is used without cmd option <session_id>, then
      the env var $X2GO_SESSION (current session) will be attempted to use.
    - Fix x2gostartagent. Make sure the -nolisten tcp option is configurable
      via x2goagent.options. (Fixes: #424).
    - Safely remove desktop files for client-side shared folders. Remove
      the correct desktop file, even if the shared folder has already
      been (forcefully) umounted. Such situations occur in cases where
      the connection gets interrupted. SSHFS will then get removed by the
      Linux kernel and we have to "guess" what desktop icons is actually
      to be removed.
    - Fix broken file descriptor closures in x2gocleansessions. (Fixes:
      #441).
    - Provide proper Gentoo support in x2goserver-xsession portion of
      X2Go Server. (Fixes: #445).
    - x2gofm.desktop: Drop obsolete Encoding key from .desktop file.
    - Fix typos / hyphen-as-minus signs issues in x2goversion.8 and
      x2gomountdirs.8.
  * x2goserver.spec:
    - Let builds for EPEL-7 behave like recent Fedora builds.
    - Spcial handling of x2gofm.desktop. In EPEL-5 the Encoding key
      is still required for .desktop files.
  * debian/*.doc-base:
    + Provide *.doc-base files for bin:packages containing HTML man pages
      or other documentation.
  * debian/x2goserver.init:
    + Add status option for init script (test if x2gocleansessions is
      running or not).
    + Add Description key to LSB header.
  * debian/config:
    + Explicitly call set -e. Makes lintian happier.
  * debian/rules:

    - Fine-tune x2goserver-xsession/Makefile: if /etc/X11 has Xsession.d and/or
      Xsession.options they get symlinked into /etc/x2go. Otherwise Xsession.d
      and Xsession.options are created under /etc/x2go as empty dir/file.
      (Fixes: #278).
    - Fix automatic keyboard setup (via x2gosetkeyboard) while resuming a
      session. (Fixes: #285).
    - Provide sudoers.d/x2goserver file that allows sudoed commands under
      KDE (by pertaining the env var QT_GRAPHICSSYSTEM. (Fixes: #276).
    - With PostgreSQL as session db backend, prevent the root user from
      launching sessions. Also, prevent x2gouser_root from being added as a
      PostgreSQL user. (Fixes: #310).
    - Execute DB status changes as late as possible during suspend / terminate.
    - Start/resume rootless sessions without geometry parameter. Esp. using
      X2GO_GEOMETRY=fullscreen for rootless sessions lead to an extra 1x1 px
      session window (nxagentCreateIconWindow in nxagent's Window.c).
    - Typo fix in x2goruncommand (for MATE session startup).
  * debian/control:
    + Update LONG_DESCRIPTIONS.
    + Raise Standards: to 3.9.4 (no changes needed).

x2goserver (4.0.0.12-0x2go1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ Mike Gabriel ]
  * Adopt this patch from stable release branch and apply to LTS branch:
    - Start/resume rootless sessions without geometry parameter. Esp. using
      X2GO_GEOMETRY=fullscreen for rootless sessions lead to an extra 1x1 px
      session window (nxagentCreateIconWindow in nxagent's Window.c).
    - Fix x2goresume-session. The several parameters placed into the NX options
      file are expected by x2goresume-session at very specific positions. This
      we broke by trying to fix the fullscreen/geometry issue in x2gostartagent.
      Thanks to Harvey Eneman for tracking this down!!!
    - Detect suspended sessions from NX log file. Also interpret a session as
      suspended if suspending just has started.

      x2goserver internal scripts.
    - Re-arranged script files into /bin and /lib directories.

    - Fix for x2gomountdirs, now also usernames containing blanks can use
      local folder sharing.
    - Provide C wrapper for setgid call of x2gosqlitewrapper.pl. Remove
      dependency from perlsuid.
    - Store SQLite db in /var/lib/x2go to comply to latest FHS.
    - Add x2gobasepath script to reliably detect x2goserver install path.
    - Add man page for x2gobasepath.
    - Remove Debianisms from INSTALL howto.
    - Add chromium-browser as possible WWWBROWSER to x2goruncommand.
    - Add lxterminal as possible TERMINAL to x2goruncommand.
    - Add LibreOffice.org as possible OFFICE application to x2goruncommand.

    - Silence x2golistsessions on missing session.log files.
    - Add x2goprint user creation information to INSTALL howto.
    - Add sanity checks to x2goprint, script can only be run as root.
    - Fix x2goprint, add syslogging, add inline comments.
    - Add script lib/x2gologlevel: introduce [log] section in x2goserver.conf
      with only parameter ,,loglevel''.
    - Initialize Syslog module for all Perl scripts in x2goserver package.
    - Add debugging support for almost all DB functions in x2godbwrapper.pm, fix
      for Syslog module initialization in all Perl scripts.
    - Add info loglevel messages for all scripts in bin dir.
    - Add notice messages for start, suspend, resume, terminate, mountdirs
      actions.
    - Fix for x2godbwrapper.pm: we can't open/close the syslog socket in a
      package. This has to be done by the scripts that use x2godbwrapper.pm.
    - Add info loglevel messages for x2goserver-extensions scripts.
    - Use usermapping for SSHFS mount points.
    - Cleanup of man page area, thanks to Ivan Kabaivanov for pointing that out.
    - Rename example user and group for session limits in x2goserver.conf so that
      people do not get the idea to put users in x2gouser group.

      X2Go session.
    - Fix x2goumount-session for individual paths (folder type: disk),

    - Let db_insertmount create a proper return value (success vs. failed).
    - If resuming or suspending of a session fails, mark the session as
      finished (because the session's x2goagent is very probably dead). 
      Do not write an error to stderr if x2goterminate-session fails (i.e. if
      x2goagent is dead).
    - Identified x2goumount script (x2goserver-compat) as a necessary
      component of x2gognomebindings and moved it there (with new name:
      x2goumount-session-gnome).
    - Add x2golistmounts script to X2Go server extensions.
    - Add x2gofeature script and x2gofeature.d subscripts.
    - Add x2gofeature man page.
    - Move x2goversion script into x2goserver core.
    - Add debug output around shadow session startup (in x2gostartagent).
    - Pass extra argument $USER to client-mode x2godesktopsharing, requires
      x2godesktopsharing (>=3.0.1.3) for it to work.
    - Clean session dir ~/.x2go/C-<session_id> after session terminates, if not
      running in debug mode.
    - Change of Desktop icons for shared folders. This change is needed for
      parallel installation of x2gognomebindings and x2golxdebindings.
    - Terminate x2godesktopsharing cleanly for current session on
      x2goterminate-session or when x2goruncommand is about to exit.
    - Resume/suspend x2godesktopsharing during x2goresume-session,
      x2gosuspend-session.
    - Provide pluggable X2Go extension system for main X2Go server
      functions.
    - Provide man page for x2goserver-run-extensions that explains the new plug-in
      mechanism of x2goserver.



  * React to Debian bug #627990, prefer man2html-base over man2html.
  * Do not depend on package perlsuid anymore.
  * Use source format 3.0 (native).
  * Fix of Debian clean rules, fix of Makefile's clean rules.
  * Breaks/replaces packages: x2goserver-one, x2goserver-home, x2goprint
    (instead ofB Conflicts).
  * Tab'ified postinst/postrm scripts.

.SH SECURITY INFORMATION / DISCLAIMER
Users are advised to not misinterpret X2GoServer's Published Application
Mode as a security feature.
.PP
Even when using Published Application Mode, it is still possible for
users to locally configure an X2Go Client with any setting they want, and
use that to connect.
.PP
So if you're trying to keep users from running a
certain application on the host, using Published Application Mode to
"lock" the configuration is the *wrong* way.  The users will still be
able to run that application by creating their own, local configuration
file and using that.
.PP
To keep users from running an application on the
server, you have to use *filesystem permissions*.  In the simplest case,
this means setting chmod 750 or 550 on the particular application on the
host, and making sure the users in question are not the owner and also
not a member of the group specified for the application.

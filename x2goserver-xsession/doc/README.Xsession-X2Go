Xsession-X2Go README
====================

With X2Go it is possible to use Xsession config files of your
local X11 system.

By default most files and folders related to Xsession config
are symlinks to the corresponding file/folder in /etc/X11.

If you want to customize your X2Go server's Xsession setup
copy the corresponding files from /etc/X11 to /etc/x2go and
adapt the setup to your needs.
